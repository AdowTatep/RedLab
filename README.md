# RedLab

A college project intended to learn JSP and servlets using java.

A laboratory/clinic administration system, where the admin can request medical exams from users, and appoint exams(like blood exams, hence the name RedLab). Then the doctor can update whether the exam is ready or not so that the user can go there and get the results. The admin can manage how much the clinic has profited.
